# Project "Kanban Board"

This project consists of client and server parts, which together create an application for task management.

## Server Part

The server part of the application is responsible for handling requests from the client side and interacting with the database.

### Used Technologies

- **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Prisma ORM:** A modern ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript, providing convenient access to the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** An object-relational database for storing information.
- **Docker:** A platform for developing, delivering, and running software using containerization. It allows packaging applications and their dependencies into containers for easy deployment and management of development and production environments.

## Client Part

The client part of the application is responsible for the user interface and interaction with the server part.

### Used Technologies

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux:** A state management library for applications.
- **Axios:** A library for making HTTP requests to the server.

### Features

- **Real-time updates:** Changes in tasks are reflected in real-time.
- **User-friendly interface:** The user interface follows Material Design principles, making it understandable and convenient to use.
